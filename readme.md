I searched the internet high and low looking for a simple facebook events widget that allows you to pull 
events from my facebook fanpage events directly to a webpage (via php). Luckly Steve Rolfe a buddy of mine helped me with whipping up this code.
This php code is embeddable into any site joomla, wordpress, etc, and takes events and lists them in a standard row.

Currently it has almost zero formatting and is a work in progress, but its a very solid foundation to getting
 a list of events from your facebook fanpage to be dynamically and seamlessly posted on your website. 
Feel free to customize it to your hearts content and if you redistribute it please link back!

Oh yes so you need 3 things to make this function:

1) AppID

2) AppSecret

3) And an Authtoken

This is now Open Source and I am not providing any support whatsoever. Feel free to modify and redistribute as you wish!

I'm not able to easily help with future improvements to this code as I haven't used it in a few years.
